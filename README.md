# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Pinia + TailwindCSS

The project is a simple user management system built with Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Pinia, and TailwindCSS. It includes basic CRUD operations for managing users.

## Project Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Run Project

You should set the environment variables before running the project.
I suggest use EasyMock(https://mock.presstime.cn/) to mock backend api.
